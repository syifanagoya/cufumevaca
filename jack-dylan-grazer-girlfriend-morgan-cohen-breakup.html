Since she is currently pregnant, she often takes her fans and followers on her pregnancy journey.</p><p>In late December 2023, she talked about what baby name she would prefer for her third child. After she revealed them, people could not help but be shocked and troll her and her husband.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nara Smith trolled for baby name</h2><p>Smith started by saying that these were the list of baby names she loves but would not be using. Then she revealed that her kids had pretty unique names — daughter Rumble Honey Smith, born October 7, 2020, and a son named Slim Easy Smith, born January 6, 2022.</p><p>In the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/C1fykJ7PiD3/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a>, she admitted that the names were “a little out there” and then listed the names she would not use for her third baby. The girl’s names included Odi, Pepper, Dawn, and Pear.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>For boys, she loved the names Frosty, Sunny, Silver, and Zen. She wanted to keep Bubble and Cherry as middle names but confessed that her husband did not like the latter.</p><p>Soon after Nara updated her fans on the baby name and her pregnancy, people started trolling her. For instance, when the Instagram handle THETEATALK posted the video, netizens took to the comment section to troll her.</p><p>Most people did not want to believe that Nara and her husband would give such names to their baby. “Is this not a joke??? Pls tell me it is,” a person commented and another wrote, “I thought she was kidding.”&nbsp;</p><p>Many noted that the baby would get bullied in the future because of their name. A netizen commented, “Those kids are definitely getting bullied,” and another chimed in, “Girl you’re gonna get those kids bullied.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nara-and-Lucky.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Nara Smith and her husband, Lucky Blue Smith, have been trolled for their choice of baby name. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Many trolled her saying people name their dogs with the names she has listed for her baby. One wrote, “These are dog names,” and another commented, “Are these dogs?”</p><p>However, many still defended Nara and her choice of baby name. “People talking about d kids are going to get bullied. Maybe if parents teach their kids to be decent human beings nobody will be getting bullied,” a netizen pointed out.</p><p>Another wrote, “Y’all are crazy fr, encouraging bullying for a decision someone made shows y’all are focused on the wrong thing.” At the time of writing, neither Nara nor her husband have revealed the name they would use for their third baby.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Trolling in the past</h2><p>This is not the first time Lucky has been trolled for the names of his children. He has three children —&nbsp; two daughters and a son.</p><p>He shares one daughter and a son with his current wife, Nara. Before he got married to Nara, he was in a relationship with Stormi Henley and had a daughter named Gravity Blue Smith, who was born on July 26, 2017.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Back in January 2022, Lucky and Nara revealed the name of their son, Slim Easy. Lucky announced the birth of his second kid with his wife, Nara, on January 8 two days after the birth.</p><p>While compliments and congratulatory messages and comments flooded in, particularly from other models, so did criticism and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trolls</a>, with several comments criticizing the couple’s baby name choice and accusing them of setting their kid up for failure.</p><p>“I’m all for unique names but this… worst name I’ve ever seen. Could’ve done better w the middle name at least. Nonetheless, I hope nothing but love and health for the newlyborn,” a netizen commented.&nbsp;</p><p>Another penned, “Why would you name your child that?!?!! It’s like you want them to be bullied. Please reevaluate this decision, there are many beautiful unique names that won’t doom your beautiful child.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Similarly, in April 2023, the names of Lucky’s children went viral on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>. There as well, people could not help but troll the couples for their choices.</p><p>A Redditor trolled, “Gravity, Rumble Honey, and Slim Easy? We should all shed a collective tear for these children and the difficulties they will face in life.”</p><p>Another commented, “All of them sound like lipsticks, not people,” and someone chimed in, “Rumble Honey is a highly-pigmented orangey-brown thick metallic gloss, Gravity is a translucent iridescent blue-hued gloss, and Slim Easy is a light rosy pink with a semi-matte finish.”</p><p>All in all, neither Lucky nor Nara have responded to the trolls and it looks like the pair are proud of the names they have selected for their children.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57zZ6urGealrCsecOyo5qmXZy%2FosbEq2SgoaKhs7O1xKebZqWfp7SiuoycpqGdnmKvs7HApKypZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./carrie-bradshaw-outfits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="18 of Carrie Bradshaw's most stylish outfits and how to recreate them">&larr;
