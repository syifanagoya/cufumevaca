He was born in New York, United States of America, on the 31st of January 1952, under the Aquarius zodiac sign. His parents are Gloria Laura Vanderbilt and Leopold Stokowski. He is an American national and belongs to a mixed ethnic background.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/Christopher-mother.jpg><p>Christopher’s father, Leopold Stokowski, was a music director/conductor in New York. He is best known for his composition works and appearance in Walt Disney’s 1940 film Fantasia. He and Gloria got married in 1945 and divorced ten years later, in 1955. Gloria won custody of their two children, Christopher and his elder brother, Stanislaus.</p><p>After his high school education, Christopher proceeded to Bard College, a private art college in the hamlet of Annandale-on-Hudson, Red Hook, New York State. Meanwhile, it was once revealed that Christopher had a hard time connecting with his mother due to her fame.</p><h2><strong>What Does&nbsp;</strong><strong>Anderson Cooper’s Brother,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Christopher Stokowski, Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Although he came to the limelight solely because of his famous family name, Christopher reportedly has a career as a musician, following in his father’s footsteps. However, there is little or no information about his career history and endeavors except that he specializes in classical musicals.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is a yet-to-be-verified report that he works under a label that does not let him receive direct credit for his work. Other than this, nothing else is known about Christopher Stokowski’s music career exploits, and none of his music is publicly known. More so, Christopher does not have a presence on any social media platform.</p><h2><strong>Christopher Stokowski’s Siblings and Half-Siblings</strong></h2><p>Christopher has only one biological sibling, a brother named Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski. His mother’s two other sons are Carter Vanderbilt Cooper and Anderson Hays Cooper and they are products of her fourth marriage to Wyatt Cooper, the late American author, screenwriter, and actor.</p><p>Furthermore, Christopher has three half-sisters on his father’s side and they are Andrea Sadja Stokowski, Sonya Maria Noel Stokowski, and Gloria Luba Stokowski. They are products of his father’s previous relationships and marriage.</p><p>Sadly, Christopher’s half-brother, who is Anderson’s only biological brother, committed suicide at the age of 23 in 1988. He jumped from the 14th floor of their mother’s apartment and died on the spot</p><h2><strong>Is Christopher Stokowski Married?</strong></h2><p>Christopher Stokowski does not reveal information about his personal and love life. But as much as the public knows, he is still single regardless of his age. Also, given that he lives his life completely away from the public and media attention, it is unknown whether he has ever gotten married. Moreover, he is publicly not known to have any children.</p><p>Records show that in 1974, Christopher Stokowski dated a lady named April Sandmaye whom he engaged three years after they met. Meanwhile, Chris started seeing his mother’s therapist shortly after his father and stepfather passed away. Not long after, he found out that his mother and the therapist were making serious plans to end his relationship with Sandmaye.</p><p>When Sandmaye got to know this, she called off the engagement herself. As a result, Christopher moved out of his family house in order to win Sandmaye’s heart back but didn’t succeed. In 1978, out of anger, Christopher Stokowski denounced his family’s fame and wealth, left New York, and told them he would never return.</p><p>For almost four decades, he did not contact or communicate with his family until 2016. According to records, it was still through Sandmaye that he reconnected to them, and for many years, his mother believed he left home to be with her. But, this seems not to be the case as the duo never continued the relationship again. Since then, Chris has not revealed any woman to be his love interest.</p><h2><strong>Did Christopher Stokowski Receive Inheritance Money From Gloria Vanderbilt?</strong></h2><p>Christopher Stokowski did not receive any inheritance from his mother. Gloria Vanderbilt died on 17th June 2019 at age 95, a few weeks after she was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer. Her will revealed that she gave her first son, Leopold Stanislaus Stokowski, her midtown Manhattan apartment, which was valued at $1.2 milliion, and&nbsp;left her remaining estates valued at around $1.5 million to her 4th son Anderson Cooper.</p><p>Christopher, who for over many decades, alienated himself from the family, got absolutely nothing from his mother. However, it is recorded that he and his mother reunited just before she passed away.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who is Christopher Stokowski?</strong></h3><p>Christopher Stokowski is best known as Anderson Cooper’s half-brother and Gloria Vanderbilt’s son.</p><h3><strong>What is Christopher Stokowski’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Christopher Stokowski’s net worth is estimated at $1 million and it is believed he made the money from his alleged music career.</p><h3><strong>How Many Siblings Does Christopher Stokowski Have?</strong></h3><p>Christopher has one biological brother, Leopold Stanislaus, and five half-siblings, which include Andrea Sadja, Sonya Maria Noel, Gloria Luba, the late Carter, and Anderson Hays Cooper.</p><h3><strong>Who are Christopher Stokowski’s parents and Grandparents?</strong></h3><p>Christopher Stokowski’s parents are Leopold Stokowski and Gloria Laura Vanderbilt.
