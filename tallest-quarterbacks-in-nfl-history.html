spiral to running with the ball and leading the teams to victory with touchdowns, quarterbacks are the most precious treasures of the NFL.</p><p>And for winning the championships and making history, a quarterback needs to earn loads of passing yards, touchdown passes, and a high percentage of pass completions during each season.</p><img

quarterbacks</a> in the NFL have incredible speed, accuracy, excellent arm strength, powerful handgrip, and smooth and consistent play movements, which all correlate to their tall heights.</p><p>With their tall stature, it is easy to look over the defense unit and overall gameplay.</p><p>Whereas their long and big hands and bulky arms give them the advantage of better ball control, making their throws reach higher and strike in the sky.</p><p>Further, it is a massive deal for the NFL to find a great quarterback who must at least be 6’3″ to enter the league.</p><p>With all that said, let’s take a quick look at the 15 tallest quarterbacks in NFL history.</p><h2>Quick Overview</h2><table style=height:487px width=1378><tbody><tr><td data-celllook=0><strong>&nbsp;S.N.</strong></td><td
