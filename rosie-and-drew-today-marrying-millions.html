Now that Season 2 is picking up, we thought we'd check in on our favorite Season 1 couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:image/webp;base64><p>Remember <a href=#>Rosie and Drew</a> from Season 1 of&nbsp;<a href=#>Marrying Millions</a>? Now that the second season has begun to air, we found ourselves wondering whatever happened to the multimillionaire landscaping company owner and his leggy sugar baby.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So, where are Rosie and Drew now a year after their season aired? And most importantly, are they <a href=#>still together</a> despite the fact that Rosie's parents highly disapproved of her dating Drew?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Drew and Rosie still together?</h2><p>At the end of Season 1, Drew and Rosie flew down to Costa Rica for a&nbsp;breathtakingly beautiful destination wedding. However, it soon became very clear that no one in Rosie’s life was even aware that she was about to get married.&nbsp;</p><p>Things really seemed to be falling apart when Rosie finally showed up to the wedding but immediately pulled Drew aside saying that they needed to talk. After a tense few minutes however, the ceremony was underway and the couple made it official.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It’s now been months since their wedding and a quick scroll through <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drew’s Instagram</a> would have you believe that the couple is no longer together since he seems to exclusively post pictures of himself and his dogs.&nbsp;</p><p>But a click over to his tagged pictures reveals that Rosie and Drew are still going strong!&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosie’s account</a> is much more active, probably because she’s the younger one of the couple and understands the power of social media. Her account is packed with pictures of her manicured nails with her massive ring, pictures of her and her friends, and selfies with Drew. She also has an entire stories highlight in which she shares pictures of the couple’s regular date nights.&nbsp;</p><p>On Drew’s most recent birthday, Rosie also posted a birthday post and said that she's “proud to call [him her] quarantine buddy.” She said that today the couple is “doing alright considering the global conditions. We are staying healthy…[and] are still together,” Rosie said before adding, “my family is still weird. [I’m living] with Drew [and I’m] pretty sure my dad just tells himself I’m away at camp.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Drew and Rosie meet?</h2><p>Season 1 couple Drew and Rosie were <a href=#>notoriously tight-lipped</a> when it came to telling audiences how the two of them met. Throughout most of the season the couple kept insisting that how they met was irrelevant since they were so in love, but yet, fans persisted in wanting to know more.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Finally, during Rosie’s bachelorette party, she let it slip to her friends that she met Drew on a sugar daddy website, a fact that most fans of the show had already guessed. While Rosie’s friends were initially shocked at her revelation, by the end of the party, they seemed to be more supportive of the arrangement.&nbsp;</p><p>But while her friends were able to come around, it seems highly unlikely that Rosie will fare just as well after revealing this detail to her conservative parents. Poor Rosie really does seem to think that her parents will come around, but if they didn’t like him when he was just some rich, old guy dating their daughter, they probably won’t be on board with the fact that the couple met through this unconventional website.</p><p>Here’s wishing the happy couple all the best for the future nonetheless!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7y0tcRmmKecXZm%2FpsOMraadmaliuqK%2B0bKgp59doratuMiopaw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./return-to-amish-recap-52117-season-4-episode-4-from-here-to-maternity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Return to Amish Recap 5/21/17: Season 4 Episode 4 From Here to Maternity">&larr;
