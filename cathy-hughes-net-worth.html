Her parents were Helen Jones Woods, a classically trained musician, and William Alfred Woods, a factory worker. Hughes grew up in a low-income household and had to overcome numerous obstacles to achieve success. She attended Creighton University in Omaha but dropped out after two years to marry Alfred Liggins Sr. The couple had a son, Alfred Liggins III, who later became the CEO of Radio One.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Hughes’ career in media began in the 1970s when she became a lecturer and then general manager at Howard University’s radio station WHUR-FM. In 1979, she purchased her first radio station, WOL-AM, with the help of a $10,000 loan. She went on to purchase more radio stations over the years, eventually creating the Radio One network, which became a publicly traded company in 1999.</p><p>Under Hughes’ leadership, Radio One became the largest African American-owned and operated broadcasting company in the country. The company expanded its media portfolio, acquiring cable networks like TV One and Reach Media, which syndicates radio shows like the Tom Joyner Morning Show and the Rickey Smiley Morning Show. In 2019, Hughes stepped down as CEO of Urban One but remains the founder and chairperson of the board.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>Hughes’ personal life has been marked by numerous challenges.
