Written by John Morton (<a href=#>Wolfwalkers</a>), The BAFTA Award winner, the show, which employs an A-list cast tells the story of a London Talent Agency that deals with frustrating clients.</p><p>The customer being ever right is a phrase that is taken too literally in this series, and the agents have to rack their heads to see to the satisfaction of their customers. If you thought the French version was epic, then the English version is here to prove you wrong. Amidst all the frustrations, the complaints, and the desire to establish the best services, do we at least get a <a href=#>second installment of the drama series</a>?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ten Percent Season 2 Release Date: When will it air?</h2><p>If you loved the first season, you are probably wondering whether it will receive a second season or not. The show’s first season only premiered recently, and word about the show’s renewal is yet to be communicated. The show has garnered 6.7/10 reviews on IMDB, which is a good sign.</p><p>The first season had eight episodes, and in the case of a second season, it might also have eight episodes or more. If the show gets renewed for the second season, then we should expect to binge on the show’s second season come 2023.</p><p>It’s tough to say, as a second season hasn’t been officially announced. However, if all goes according to plan and season 2 begins filming soon, then maybe we should anticipate the new episodes to air roughly a year after Season 1 concluded or in spring 2023.</p><p>As of recent updates, the second season of Ten Percent will not be happening. The show’s debut season was available for streaming on <a href=#>Amazon Prime Video</a> in the U.K in April 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ten Percent Season 2 Plot: What will happen?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ten-percent-plot.jpg><p>Season one left us on quite a Cliffhanger when it did not seal the loose ends regarding Jonathan’s relationship. After finding out that he had had an illegitimate child, his wife left him. The illegitimate child may have been born while still in the marriage. The season finale hinted at a possible reunion between the couple, but it was not so straightforward. The wife, however, does not know about the other fling, and despite nothing happening between his husband and Julia, it might be a topic for future fights. With Misha stepping up to be an agent and Rebecca’s project doing so well, there is still a lot that can be explored in the <a href=#>upcoming series</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ten Percent Season 2 Cast: Who will be in it?</h2><p>All cast members are expected to be back except Richard Nightingale, who died in the season one pilot episode. The four main agents, Hiftu Quasem, Rebecca Humphries, and Harry Trevaldwyn, will be back in the second season of the comedy show. Season one also had special appearances, including Kelly Macdonald (<a href=#>Line of Duty</a>), Emma Corinne (<a href=#>The Crown</a>), David Oyelowo (<a href=#>Chaos Walking</a>), and Phoebe Dyenevor. Since the French version had more than one cameo, the second season might see another fresh bunch of celebrities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ten Percent Season 2 Trailer: When can we watch it?</h2><p>A second season trailer cannot be released as the series has been canceled. As we wait for the second season’s possible debut, there are similar series like 10 percent, and you could first start by watching the Original show, Call my Agent. Life After Life, <a href=#>Slow Horses</a>, <a href=#>Anatomy of Scandal</a>, and DI Ray are some of the series you’ll find relatable.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ten Percent Season 1 Recap:</h2><p>The show takes place in Nightingale Hart, a talent agency located in London, and revolves around the lives of the agents and their famous clients. In the first season, the agency faces a major upheaval when its founder, Richard Nightingale, unexpectedly passes away. As a result, Jonathan Nightingale, Rebecca Fox, Stella Hart, and Dan Bala, along with the rest of the team, must navigate the aftermath of this loss while also dealing with their own personal and professional difficulties.</p><p>Adding to the complexity, Misha, Jonathan’s daughter from an extramarital affair, becomes an assistant at the agency right as her father’s death occurs. Jonathan and Stella soon discover that the agency is encountering financial troubles, and they must work tirelessly to keep it afloat. Meanwhile, Rebecca endeavors to establish a production branch within the agency while simultaneously developing feelings for Margaux, the author of the book she plans to adapt. Dan, on the other hand, attempts to launch the acting career of Zoe, their former receptionist, while also falling for her.</p><p>Throughout their journey, the agents must also contend with their demanding celebrity clients while warding off the influence of the American company that acquired the agency.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ten Percent Season 1 Review:</h2><p>The first season of Ten Percent has <a href=#>received a variety of reviews from critics</a>. As per Rotten Tomatoes, the show has achieved a Tomatometer score of 92%. Some critics have commended the series for its exceptional cast and inclusion of celebrity guest stars, while others have expressed their dissatisfaction, deeming it an inadequate adaptation of the original French show, Call My Agent!.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ten Percent Season 1 Rating:</h2><p>The first season of Ten Percent is well-received, with a Tomatometer score of 75% based on 24 reviews and an Audience Score of 63% based on fewer than 50 ratings, according to Rotten Tomatoes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where Can I Watch Ten Percent Season 1?</h2><p>The first season of Ten Percent comprises 8 episodes and can be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK57056lZqiVp7CmutNmqp6Zo6S7br7EpZyaq5VisaLAxGaamqukYr2tu9NmrKmckamytHnTq5iipJWnfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./george-steele.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="George Steele Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">&larr;
